# Music Detection and Music Relative Loudness Estimation

## Requirements
- `PyTorch` for the deep learning implementations.
- `librosa` for the pre-processing of the audio ([link](https://github.com/librosa/librosa "librosa")).
- `dcase_util` A collection of utilities for Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events ([link](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/dcase_util "dcase_util"))
- `sed_eval` for the evaluation of the models ([link](https://github.com/TUT-ARG/sed_eval "sed_eval")).
- `sed_vis` for visualizing the annotations. ([link](https://github.com/TUT-ARG/sed_vis "sed_vis"))
- `pandas`

## Data
OpenBMAT dataset ([link](https://zenodo.org/record/3381249 "OpenBMAT"))

In the earliest version of our paper, we call our model HEDLN. It is substituted by HRIN in the newest manuscript. However, we haven't changed the abbreviation in the code, so don't get confused.
